Android Activity Lifecycle 
The Android Activity Lifecycle is arranged by 7 approaches for android.app. Activity class. The android Activity class is a subclass of the ContextThemeWrapper class.
On Android, a movement is a single screen. It is similar to a Java window or edge. You may arrange all of your UI components or gadgets on a single screen with the help of action.
The Activity 7 lifecycle approach describes how action will behave in various situations.
 Activity Lifecycle
■ Activities in the foreground are running (onResume)
■ If something transparent obscurs the activity it is paused (onPause)
■ If you can’t see the activity it is stopped. (onStop)
■ If it is garbage collected (onDestroy)
Android Activity
  Life Cycle
    Lifetime:
      1: onCreate() 
      2: onDestroy()
     Visible when:
      3: onStart() 
      4: onStop()
      5: onRestart
     Foreground
      6: onResume 
      7: onPause()
      
       
    Step 1:
    creat a Project in Android studio name it "7-sky" //due to 7 Activiy Life cycle
    step2:
    open the Main.java
    add the code 
    
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import android.widget.Toast;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
//    Create button is already build by android
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        Log.i("lifecycle","onCreate invoke");
        Toast.makeText(this, "OnCreate Activity is Created", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();


    }
    protected void onStart() {
// as these method (on start, create ,..., restart  are by default created in the parent class as we are using it inside the child class so we are using 
// super.onStart as we are calling it from parent class
        super.onStart();
 //log is just like a print statement ( it contain two arguments one is Name tage; as we are having alot of log generated by the gridle so it help us in finding out specifivc log by its name /tag
 //second argument is the messages) 
        Log.i("lifecycle","onStart invoke");
 //toat is used to dispay the message it can be for short and long time        
        Toast.makeText(this, "OnStart Activity Start", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();


    }
    protected void onResume() {

        super.onResume();
        Log.i("lifecycle","onResume invoke");
        Toast.makeText(this, "OnResume Activity Resume", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
    protected void onPause() {

        super.onPause();
        Log.i("lifecycle","onPause invoke");
        Toast.makeText(this, "OnPause Activity Pasused", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
    protected void onStop() {

        super.onStop();
        Log.i("lifecycle","onStop invoke");
        Toast.makeText(this, "OnStop Activity Stop", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
    protected void onDestroy() {

        super.onDestroy();
        Log.i("lifecycle","onDestroy invoke");
        Toast.makeText(this, "OnDestroy Activity Destroyed", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
    protected void onRestart() {

        super.onRestart();
        Log.i("lifecycle","onRestart invoke");
        Toast.makeText(this, "OnRestart Activity Restart", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
}
Step 3: 
run the app 
done
